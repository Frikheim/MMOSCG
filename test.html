        <p>Education is a basic human right, enshrined in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1951 Refugee Convention.

        Three million Syrian children are out of school because of the conflict in Syria. Half of the refugee children are not receiving any form of education. Schools in Syria are under attack every day, and every day parents keep their children home. 

        We have developed an app to help these children. An app that can be used anywhere around the world on most mobile phones today. So it can reach these children where ever they are.</p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>    
        <p>Although the Syrian conflict is one of the biggest humanitarian crises in recent history, it is an educational crisis as well. The disrupt in the education of millions of Syrian children is one of the consequences of the Syrian crisis, and it is not one to take very lightly. Basic literacy skills in reading and writing is essential for a lifelong learning, and having lost the access to basic literacy can cause almost the whole next generation of Syrian children to become illiterate.

        The children in Syria do have their rights in getting educational teaching, but the situation in Syria has caused a lot of damage to many schools. It is really essential in focusing on the children in and around the Syrian region in addition to the refugees. In a report from Save the World done in 2015, we get informed that “almost 3 million Syrian children are out of school”. Not only is that a bad situation educational wise, but also security wise. The report from Save the Children also tells us that children being in school will give them a sense of stability in their lives and in addition give them safety and protect them from risks of getting into child laboring and recruitment to militant groups.

        Even though many of the host countries of the Syrian refugees do have good educational and integration facilities they do cause some barriers for Syrian refugees in terms of the curriculum, the language and discrimination. In addition to these barriers the lack of trying to preserve the Syrian heritage can be seen as well, especially the youngest of the Syrian refugees need to be literate in their mother tongue for an eventual return to their homeland when the political situation gets better.

        <h3>Solution</h3>    
        <p>We have developed the app to help solve the child educational crisis in Syria. An app is an ideal tool because of the high level of smartphone ownership among syrians. The app teaches the children both their native language and english, and focuses on teaching writing and reading skills. This makes it easier for the children to integrate into education systems after the conflict is over. The content is divided into several categories, possible categories  are reading, writing and math.The app consist primarily of games, both educational and non-educational. The app also includes educational and healthcare information. The games are included to help reduce the stress and anxiety that syrian children face, to increase their ability to learn and reduce the risk of stress related problems, like impeded brain development, learning challenges, memory problems and emotional control impediments. The educational games provide a stress reducing way to learn. The app also provides easy access to educational materials and healthcare information made specifically for syrian children. The app enables communication between the children and with teachers and counselors. The app tracks and shows the child’s progression in the different categories and allows them to compare themselves with other uses.

        <h3>About the app</h3>
        <p>During the construction of this app our main focus was, neither on the fun of learning nor the actual learning itself, but rather on the children and their equal opportunity to make it in life. The essential of our work is aiming towards children’s ability to learn in any form. Imagine being in the middle of the heart of any crisis and the life-threatening situation many of these children in the world is experiencing every day. With all the emotions going through their head, and the emotive condition they are finding themselves in, it all makes it harder for them to enjoy the small things in life and even see past through their present moment of life.</p>
